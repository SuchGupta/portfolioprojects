Business Case:HELP International has raised around $10 Mn as part of its funding programmes.
It wants to make a strategic and effective decision to select those countries that are in the direst need of aid and where this money can be used most effectively.

Business Approach: HELP International has provided a data that comprises of socio-economic factors for a list of 167 countries that are expected to be in need of aid. Based on the Clustering model approach and with the support of analytical inferences, business shall zero-down on the final list of countries.
Pre-Clustering Hypothesis of the features of countries that shall qualify for aid:

The countries have low nominal GDP resulting in high inflation Due to low nominal GDP.
The countries have high imports and possibly low exports.
These countries could have low net income per person due to which the buying capacity is low. Hence, the countries that might qualify could also have low inflation.
The countries have high mortality rate High mortality rate could be due to low health expenditure per capita.
High mortality rate could be due to high fertility rate faced by these countries.
These countries have low health expenditure that ultimately results in low life expectancy
